Wildfires
>Remove natural fuels such as dry grass, brush and trees, from within 100 feet of your home.
>Lop off dead branches over the roof of a house and within 10 feet of a chimney.
>Move firewood piles away from all structures.
>Prune the branches of taller trees to six feet above the ground so that a ground fire cannot climb into the crown of the trees.
>No matter how attractive they look, never cover a roof with wooden cedar shingles. Fiery brands and ash often precede a wildfire and can ignite a wooden roof miles from the main fire.
>Enclose the underside of porches and decks to keep fire from creeping under the house.
>Clearly mark all water sources on your property so firefighters can easily get to them.
>Be aware that firefighters may avoid homes where the driveway provides no turnaround for fire engines, homes on roads with light bridges that won't carry heavy, water-laden trucks, and homes at the heads of forested draws

Volcanoes
>If a lava flow is headed toward you
	-Leave the area immediately. If you are warned to evacuate because an eruption is imminent, evacuate.
	-If you can drive rather than walk, use your vehicle to evacuate. When driving keep doors and windows closed, drive across the path of danger if you can or away from the danger if you can not, and watch for unusual hazards in the road.
>If you are indoors
	-Close all windows, doors, and fireplace or woodstove dampers.
	-Turn off all fans and heating and air conditioning systems.
	-Bring pets and livestock into closed shelters.
>If you are outdoors
	-Seek shelter indoors.
	-If caught in a rockfall, roll into a ball to protect your head.
	-If near a stream or river, be aware of rising water and possible mudflows in low-lying areas. Move up-slope as quickly as possible.
	-Seek care for burns right away. Immediate care can be life saving.
	-If your eyes, nose, and throat become irritated from volcanic gases and fumes, move away from the area immediately. Your symptoms should go away when you are no longer in contact with the gases or fumes. If the symptoms continue, consult your doctor.
	-Protecting yourself during ashfallPhoto of respiratory mask.
	-Stay inside, if possible, with windows and doors closed.
	-Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants.
	-Use goggles to protect your eyes.If ash is continually falling, you may not be able to shelter indoors for more than a few hours, because the weight of the ash could collapse the roof of your building and block air intakes into the building. Listen to authorities for advice on leaving the area when ashfall lasts more than a few hours.
	-Keep your car or truck engine switched off. Avoid driving in heavy ashfall. Driving will stir up ash that can clog engines and stall vehicles. If you do have to drive, keep the car windows up and do not operate the air conditioning system. Operating the air conditioning system will bring in outside air and ash.

Dust & Haze
>Stay Indoors
	-Clearly one of the best ways to battle the health effects of haze is to avoid going outdoors. Stay indoors as much as possible and shut the windows. Switch on the air conditioner if possible or use suitable air filters and air purifiers in order to remove dust particles and contaminants in the air.
>AVOID Heavy Outdoor Activities
 	-Of course, it will be very helpful if you try your best to minimize your duration of exposure in the heavy outdoor activities. If you have to do outdoor sports or exercises, then you must do it on the indoor or, maybe you can just postpone it instead. Aerobic activities such as running, cycling or playing football will require deep breathing and that would mean inhaling all the harmful pollutants in the air. Those who have pre-existing chronic heart or lung conditions, or who are not feeling well should avoid going out. Even if you do not have a pre-existing condition, it is still better to be safe than you inhale all of the miniscule dust particles, which able to increase one’s risk of developing viral and bacterial infections.
>Wear A N95 Mask
 	-If you must go outdoors, put on a respiratory mask. Surgical masks or paper masks do not offer any protection against the solid particles present in the air. It is not a recommended safety plan, for recent environment condition. An appropriate respiratory mask to combat the haze would be the N95 mask, which is designed to filter airborne particles and protect wearers from inhaling the haze particles. These respiratory masks are available at major pharmacies and supermarkets.
>Increase Fiber Intake
	-Eating more fruits and vegetables that are rich in vitamins A and C can boost your immune system, seriously. Foods rich in vitamin A include carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach and are known to protect your eyes and lungs from air pollution. Foods rich in vitamin C like oranges, kiwis and broccoli can promote lung tissue health and prevent you from catching the common flu. So what are you waiting for? Just go to buy these things first, and continue to read these secrets we are going to share with you.
>Take Medication To Alleviate Symptoms
	-Haze can cause some adverse effects on your health including eye irritation, running or stuffy nose, throat irritation, headache or lung inflammation. These symptoms will definitely disturb your daily activity. So, a piece of advice, if you experience any of these symptoms, you might want to relieve them with eye drops or cough tablets and mixtures available at pharmacies, however, it is better to consult with your doctor first.
>Stop Smoking
	-On top of the toxins present in the hazy air outdoors, the last thing you want to do is to further irritate your lungs, and eventually any lungs around you, with cigarette smoking. Smoking will make your lungs more sensitive to the effects of air pollutants in this hazy environment.
>Pay Attention To Air Quality Updates
	-Check the local environment agency’s website regularly for updates on the latest air condition. You can visit AQICN for live updates on the latest PSI readings to verify if the air quality is within a healthy PSI range. Check here guys: aqicn.org/map/malaysia/
>Stay Hydrated
	-Please, drink more water, I mean mineral water. Bring along a water bottle with you if you need to stay outdoor for a while. Given that haze can irritate your throat, causing it to be dry or sore or even lead to coughing, it is essential to drink up to flush away the toxins absorbed through the skin and lungs. Eat more fruits and drink juice such as apples, papayas, coconut water and watermelon juice to stay cool.
>Go Salmon Go
	-As we know, oily fish such as salmon is rich in omega-3 and antioxidant such as vitamin C and E in it. They are effective to help to provide a stronger body to fight against haze problem and irritation.

Drought
>Indoors
	-Use washing machines for full loads only.
	-Run the dishwasher only when full.
	-When washing dishes by hand, don’t let the water run. Fill one basin with wash water and the other with rinse water.
	-Install an aerator on your kitchen faucet to reduce flow to less than 1 gallon per minute.
	-Use the garbage disposal sparingly. Alternatively, you can compost vegetable food waste and save gallons of water every time.
	-Install low-flow shower heads.
	-Take a five minute shower instead of a 10 minute one.
	-Turn your bathroom faucet off when brushing your teeth or shaving.
>Outdoors
	-Water early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures are cooler.
	-Adjust your sprinklers to ensure only your yard is being watered, not your house, sidewalk or street.
	-Put a layer of mulch around trees and plants to reduce evaporation and keep the soil cool.
	-Landscape your yard with climate appropriate plants.
	-Use a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways, sidewalks and patios.
	-Wash vehicles with a bucket and sponge, and make sure your hose has a self-closing nozzle.


Earthquakes
>Fasten shelves securely to walls, and place heavy objects on lower shelves.
>Store breakable items in low, closed cabinets.
>Hang items such as pictures and mirrors away from beds and anywhere people sit.
>Brace hanging light fixtures.
>Repair known defective electrical wiring and gas connections.
>Strap your water heater to studs in the wall and bolt it to the floor.
>Repair any large existing cracks in walls or foundations.
>Store poisons such as pesticides and herbicides, as well as flammable liquids, on bottoms shelves of latched cabinets.
>Identify safe places in each room (under sturdy furniture, against inside walls, away from glass).
>Locate safe places outdoors (away from buildings, trees, electrical lines, and bridges).
>Teach family members how to turn off gas, electricity, and water.
>Teach children how to dial 911 in an emergency.
>Have disaster supplies on hand (flashlight and extra batteries, battery operated radio, fist aid kit with manual, emergency food and drinking water, non electric can opener, cash, sturdy shoes).
>Develop an emergency communications plan in case family members are separated.

Landslides
>To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.
>Prepare for landslides by following proper land-use procedures - avoid building near steep slopes, close to mountain edges, near drainage ways or along natural erosion valleys.
>Become familiar with the land around you. Learn whether debris flows have occurred in your area by contacting local officials. Slopes where debris flows have occurred in the past are likely to experience them in the future.
>Get a ground assessment of your property.
>Consult a professional for advice on appropriate preventative measures for your home or business, such as flexible pipe fittings, which can better resist breakage.
>Protect your property by planting ground cover on slopes and building retaining walls.
>In mudflow areas, build channels or deflection walls to direct the flow around buildings. Be aware, however, if you build walls to divert debris flow and the flow lands on a neighbor's property, you may be liable for damages.
>If you are at risk from a landslide talk to your insurance agent. Debris flow may be covered by flood insurance policies from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
>Recognize Landslide Warning Signs
>Changes occur in your landscape such as patterns of storm-water drainage on slopes (especially the places where runoff water converges) land movement, small slides, flows, or progressively leaning trees.
>Doors or windows stick or jam for the first time.
>New cracks appear in plaster, tile, brick, or foundations.
>Outside walls, walks, or stairs begin pulling away from the building.
>Slowly developing, widening cracks appear on the ground or on paved areas such as streets or driveways.
>Underground utility lines break.
>Bulging ground appears at the base of a slope.
>Water breaks through the ground surface in new locations.
>Fences, retaining walls, utility poles, or trees tilt or move.
>A faint rumbling sound that increases in volume is noticeable as the landslide nears.
>The ground slopes downward in one direction and may begin shifting in that direction under your feet.
>Unusual sounds, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together, might indicate moving debris.
>Collapsed pavement, mud, fallen rocks, and other indications of possible debris flow can be seen when driving (embankments along roadsides are particularly susceptible to landslides).

Severe Storms
>Before
	-Trim dead branches and cut down dead trees to reduce the danger of these falling onto your house during a storm.
	-Clean gutters, drains and downpipes.
	-Make sure your roof is in good repair.
	-Prepare an emergency kit.
	-When a storm is imminent
	-Always check the weather forecast before heading out on the water. Do not go boating in a storm. If you are on the water and see bad weather approaching, head for shore immediately. Remember to file a sail plan with a responsible person, and frequently monitor the VHF marine or Weatheradio broadcast throughout your trip.
	-Secure everything that might be blown around or torn loose – indoors and outdoors. Flying objects such as garbage cans and lawn furniture can injure people and damage property.
	-Consider going to the sheltered area that you and your family identified in your emergency plan.

>During a storm
	-If you are indoors during a storm, stay away from windows, doors and fireplaces.
	-If you are advised by officials to evacuate, do so. Delay may make later evacuation difficult or impossible. Take your emergency kit with you.
	-If indoors, you can use a cellular or cordless telephone during a severe storm, but it is not safe to use a corded telephone.
	-If you are in a car, stop the car away from trees or power lines that might fall on you. Avoid the base of steep or unstable slopes and low areas prone to flooding. Stay inside the car.

Termperature Extremes
>Heat
	-Build a disaster supply kit and make a family plan
	-If installing window air conditioners, install them snugly and insulate if necessary
	-Check air-conditioning ducts for proper insulation
	-Install temporary window reflectors (for use between windows and drapes), such as aluminum foil-covered cardboard, to reflect heat back outside
	-Weather-strip doors and sills to keep cool air in
	-Cover windows that receive morning or afternoon sun with drapes, shades, awnings, or louvers—outdoor awnings or louvers can reduce the heat that enters a home by up to 80 percent
	-Keep storm windows up all year
	-Listen to local weather forecasts and stay aware of upcoming temperature changes
	-Know those in your neighborhood who are elderly, young, or in poor health—they are more likely to become victims of excessive heat and may need help
	-Be aware that people living in urban areas may be at greater risk from the effects of a prolonged heat wave than are people living in rural areas
	-Get trained in first aid to learn how to treat heat-related emergencies

Water Colors
	-Avoid having hydrogen sulfide gas at bottom of the ocean
